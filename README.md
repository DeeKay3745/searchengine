# Application README

## Overview
This repository contains a Python application defined in [`app.py`](./app.py).  
It provides functionality related to search and response generation using an LLM (Large Language Model).  
The app is designed to be modular, easy to configure, and extendable for experimentation with different models and settings.

## Features
- Command-line or script-based execution of the app.
- Integration with language models for query handling.
- Configurable parameters (API keys, temperature, max tokens, etc.).
- Clean project structure for further enhancements.
